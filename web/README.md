  - title: Integrated
    details: Your containers can access the D-Bus instances, manipulate devices,
             and even export installed applications onto your host system.
  - title: Flexible
    details: Containers can optionally run their own init, and you can create custom
             base images for your containers built on Ansible playbooks.
  - title: Adaptable
    details: nsbox was built so that any improvements to the base images will be
             retroactively applied to already-existing containers.
